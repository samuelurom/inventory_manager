# Welcome to the CLI Inventory Management program!

This is a command-line based application that allows you to manage your inventory and keep track of your products. The data is persisted in an external CSV `inventory.txt` file. This application is built with strong object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts in Python, making it easy to maintain and extend.

With this program, you can add new products to your inventory, restock existing products, search and view your inventory in a variety of ways. It's a simple yet powerful tool for anyone looking to manage their inventory efficiently.

To get started, simply clone the repository and run the program. I hope you find it useful and I welcome any feedback or contributions. Thank you for using the CLI Inventory Management program!

Please feel free to clone or download this repository to run the program.

This program utilises the Python tabulate module. Before running the `inventory.py` file ensure that you have the Python tabulate module installed by running:

```commandline
pip install tabulate
```
